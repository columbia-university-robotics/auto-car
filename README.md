## Contributing
To contribute code to this repository, you must:

1. Ensure your current code does not affect major changes from the most recent master branch. To do this, constantly run `git pull` every time you write new code locally.
2. [Submit a pull request](https://github.com/columbia-university-robotics/mate-rov/pulls) to commit the changes to the repository. You'll require **one approval** from another developer before the code can be merged to the `master` branch.
3. Once approved, your remote branch will be committed to `master`.

## Naming Commits

### Do
Provide short, accurate descriptions of your code changes.

For example:

- `Fixed backwards/forwards mixup bug`
- `Changed tracking tolerance to 0.9`

### Don't
Provide long or cryptic commit messages.

For example:

- `Created a new technique that tracks the presence of baby dolphins in the pool and propels the robot to swim directly to these dolphins`
- `Updated driver code`

## Naming Remote Branches

### `feat-FEATURE_NAME`
Name your remote branch this if you are working on an entirely new feature for the project.

### `fix-FEATURE_NAME-##`
Name your remote branch this if you are fixing an already-existing feature. Feel free to add or ommit numbers at the end of the name to discern your branch from others.

## `refactor-FEATURE_NAME`
Name your remote branch this if you are refactoring something in an already-existing feature, such as changing a variable name. The above applies here.
